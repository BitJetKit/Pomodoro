Although the original Java app is mostly complete, that app is not including the sufficient code to select pomodoro choices after the 1st iteration. So, I fixed the app, and I 
uploaded it, here. You can select your total pomodoros, short break time, long break time, and whether or not you need to use the pomodoro timer(s), again. In the future, this little personal project will contain a complete graphical user interface using Java Swing.
